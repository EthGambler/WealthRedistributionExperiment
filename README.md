# Zero Ponzi
Ok, I was getting a bit disipointed with all the over-the top Ponzi schemes floating around, especially with all the creators taking 10% for doing nothing. So I put together my own (from scratch, no copy & paste) with 0% going to the creator and a 125% return.

Send between 100 finney (0.1 ether) and 10 ether to (like the 1.25 multiplier, the 10 ether maximum is set "low" to allow payout flows)
